How SQL Developer Handles Data Fetching:
Initial Query Execution:

When you run a query like SELECT * FROM meter in SQL Developer, it submits the entire query to the database.
The database executes the query and prepares a result set, which contains all the rows matching the query.
Data Fetching in Batches:

SQL Developer does not retrieve all the rows at once. Instead, it fetches a small number of rows (a batch), often around 50 or 100 rows, and displays them in the grid.
It uses a concept called "fetch size", which specifies how many rows should be fetched at once. The default fetch size can vary, but it's typically small (50â€“200 rows), allowing SQL Developer to display the first portion of the result set quickly.
As you scroll through the result set, SQL Developer requests the next batch of rows from the database. This happens seamlessly in the background, without re-running or modifying the original query.
No Query Modification:

SQL Developer does not modify the original query by adding LIMIT, OFFSET, or ROWNUM clauses to it. It uses Oracle's cursor mechanism to retrieve data in batches from the result set created by the original query.
The entire result set is available on the database server, but it is transferred to the client (SQL Developer) in smaller batches to reduce memory consumption and improve performance.
Data Scrolling:

When you scroll down to see more rows, SQL Developer fetches the next batch and appends it to the result grid. This process continues until all rows in the result set have been fetched.
The fetch size is adjustable in SQL Developer, allowing users to balance between initial load time and memory usage.
Key Mechanisms:
Cursor Fetching: SQL Developer opens a cursor for the query, which is essentially a pointer to the result set. The cursor allows SQL Developer to retrieve rows incrementally without having to load the entire result set at once.

Prefetching: In Oracle, the row prefetching mechanism allows the client to fetch a batch of rows from the server in a single round trip, reducing the number of network round trips required for large result sets.

Why is SQL Developer Fast?
Efficiency: SQL Developer retrieves only a few rows at first and waits until the user scrolls to fetch more. This allows it to display results quickly, even for very large tables.

Optimized for Fetching: SQL Developer uses efficient network communication (prefetching and cursor fetching) to minimize overhead.

Can You Do the Same in Your Application?
Yes, you can achieve similar behavior in your C# application by:

Fetching Data in Batches: Just like SQL Developer, your app can fetch 50 rows at a time using ROWNUM or Oracle's cursor fetching.
Virtual Scrolling: As the user scrolls, fetch the next batch of rows from the database.
Using Oracle Cursors: In C#, you can use Oracle's cursor mechanism to open a result set and fetch rows incrementally without modifying the original query.
